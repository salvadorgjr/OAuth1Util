# OAuth1Util
The purpose of writing this utility was the need to integrate Salesforce with a system that was not yet updated to use OAuth2. Salesforce had since removed the ability to easily configure your organization to use OAuth 1, so we had to write our own.
There are a few other OAuth1 projects floating about, but I found them to be a bit overengineered.
While I understand that this may not be the most secure way to connect to another system, if there is no way other than to use OAuth1, then here it is.
